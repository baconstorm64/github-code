General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================


`Neo_Up` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Up.java` class.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?
Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->
I focused only on this implementation. I accidentally started a binary search in the lab. When Dr. Denning started talking about the binary search, I realized what I was doing.
I haven't successfully implemented the binary search, but I do know how it works and that it would be extremely efficient.


`Neo_Down` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Down.java` class.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?
Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->

No implementation

`Neo_Left` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Down.java` class.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?
Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->
No implementation

`Neo_Right` Implementation
---------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Down.java` class.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?
Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->
No implementation

Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

The binary search currently seems to be stuck in an endless loop.



Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

This was the funnest lab I've ever had. Thinking about an algorithm to find the first one was extremely fun.
I was very excited when I realized that I had accidentally come up with the binary search algorithm. Given a bit more time, I think I could finish the Neo_Up successfully.



<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->

<!-- ... -->



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
