<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features, extra credit)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Take a look at the [Markdeep Feature Demo](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) to see how you can markup this document.



Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================

<!--
Provide a summary of how the algorithm or data structure works.
Describe briefly how you implemented each class/function/data structure/algorithm/etc.
How did you check whether the program was working correctly?
Did you test parts individually?
How long did it take to run each implementation against each set of data?
How does the length/structure of the data impact the runtime of the algorithm?
Do the results surprise you?
Provide a short explanation on what you learned about these two implementations.
How are they the same? How are they different?

Brute Force Search
---------------------

The brute force search was taken from the Algorithms book. It's obviously going to be less effective than the binary search because it's just going through every single index of the list


Binary Search
-----------------

The binary search was also taken from the Algorithms book. It's much  faster because it doesn't search through every single index of the checklist.


Runtimes
---------

At first I messed up my code so brute and binary took about the same time. After correcting it, I found that it does take extremely long to run brute force.


<!-- update the table below with your input sizes and runtimes -->
<!-- create additional rows as needed (should run more than 2 tests!) -->
algorithm | whitelist sz | checklist sz | time (secs)
----------|--------------|--------------|-------------
brute     | 15           | 18           | ~1 second
binary    | 15           | 18           | ~1 second
brute     | 1000000      | 10000000     | >10 minutes
binary    | 1000000      | 10000000     | 26.44 sec





Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

None that I can think of


Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

I was confused by the assignment writeup, so I went to Dr. Denning to confirm that what I was doing was correct.
The binary search algorithm is much faster than the brute force, which is to be expected. At first I didn't implement either method properly.
After correcting my methods, I found that the binary search is extremely efficient, which was expected.
