# Ride Share Repo

## Getting Started
Copy the repo and cd into ride-share. Run yarn. Then run ```yarn api-watch``` and ```yarn ui-watch```

## Possible Problems
As you can see, there are plenty of buttons that are labled with (work in progress). Those functions weren't finished due to the time constraint put in place. When you click on those, there will be a form, but clicking the submit button won't actually allow functionality. To verify the changes have been made, you will have to go into the database and view the changes directly there.

## Update Vehicle Tab
Inside the update vehicle tab, you must put all of the vehicle information in, or it won't work. We couldn't figure out how to allow just one change within the form (and due to time restraints we kept it this way).

## Design Choices
This webpage isn't the most beautiful page in the world. As I think is true with every development process, you need to get the functionality down (which we couldn't fully do sadly) before you begin to focus on the beautification of the page. Therefore, the admin, passenger, and driver page are just a bunch of buttons to test out the functionality instead of a gorgeous webpage like most people probably have at this point in the semester.

## Pseudocode
If you look in ```db.js```, there will be pseudocode/explanations (commented out) for the routes that couldn't be worked on in time.
