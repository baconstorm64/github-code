# Random Code
This is just all my random code that I create in various languages. It started when I wanted to automate my stats stuff even though the functions for it already existed on my calculator. I don't know why, I just wanted to. This is nothing serious so don't expect some high level amazing algorithmic code. I'm doing this in my spare time so I'm not giving it a whole lot of thought.
